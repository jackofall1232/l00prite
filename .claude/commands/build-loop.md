description: Scaffold CLAUDE.md, .l00prite memory, Codex prompts, and a skeleton repo from a project idea. Does NOT execute it.
---

You are running the `/build-loop` command from the l00prite project. Your job in this
invocation is to **scaffold a blueprint and persistent loop memory**, not to build anything. Follow the steps below
in order. Do not skip ahead, do not combine steps, and do not execute any part of the
blueprint you produce.

The user's project idea (if provided as an argument to this command) is:

$ARGUMENTS

If no idea was provided as an argument, ask the user to describe the project they want to
build before continuing to Step 1.

---

## Step 1 — Ask clarifying questions (REQUIRED, do this first)

Before generating anything, ask the user for the following. Ask all of them together in one
message, not one at a time:

1. **Project type** — what kind of thing is this (CLI tool, web app, API/service, library,
   browser extension, WordPress/CMS plugin, data pipeline, mobile app, game, etc.)?
2. **Scope** — what's the minimum viable version? What is explicitly out of scope for v1?
3. **Target languages/stack** — programming language(s), frameworks, runtimes, package
   managers.
4. **Target repo** — an existing local path/repo to scaffold into, or "new repo" (and if
   new, where should it live)?
5. **Hard constraints** — deadlines, must-use libraries or APIs, deployment target,
   licensing requirements, anything else non-negotiable.

**Do not proceed to Step 2 until the user has answered all five.** The only exception: if
the user explicitly says something like "use your judgment" for a given item, you may fill
that one item in with a reasonable, clearly-labeled default — state the default you chose
out loud. Do not silently assume defaults for items the user hasn't addressed at all.

## Step 2 — Pick a complexity tier

Based on the answers from Step 1, choose one of three tiers: **small**, **medium**, or
**large**. Use this rough guidance:

- **small** — single-purpose script, plugin, CLI tool, or narrow library. One main
  responsibility, few or no external services, a handful of files.
- **medium** — a web app or service with a few moving parts: an API layer plus a small
  amount of business logic, maybe a database or a couple of integrations, config and basic
  CI.
- **large** — a multi-service or multi-module system: several independently meaningful
  components, integration tests, infra/deployment concerns, architecture decisions worth
  recording.

Tell the user which tier you picked **and explain why**, referencing their actual answers
(e.g., "You described a single WordPress plugin with one settings page and no external
services, so this is **small** tier."). If it's genuinely borderline, say so and pick the
smaller of the two — it's cheaper to upgrade a skeleton later than to have over-scaffolded.

## Step 3 — Generate the target project's CLAUDE.md

Read `templates/CLAUDE.md.template` from this repo. Fill in every `{{placeholder}}` with
content specific to the user's project, based on their Step 1 answers and the tier chosen
in Step 2. The output must:

- Preserve all 8 section headers, in order: Mission, Architecture, Requirements,
  Definition of Done, Agent Operating Loop, Heartbeat Rules, Run Ledger, Completion
  Criteria.
- Contain **zero** leftover instances of this template's own placeholder tokens or bracketed
  guidance comments: `{{mission_statement}}`, `{{architecture_overview}}`,
  `{{requirements_list}}`, `{{requirement_1}}`, `{{requirement_2}}`,
  `{{definition_of_done_checklist}}`, `{{done_condition_1}}`, `{{done_condition_2}}`,
  `{{generator_role}}`, `{{evaluator_role}}`, `{{loop_description}}`, `{{max_iterations}}`,
  `{{human_review_gates}}`, `{{branch_policy}}`, `{{completion_criteria_list}}`,
  `{{completion_criterion_1}}`, `{{completion_criterion_2}}` — every one must be replaced
  with real, specific content. Before showing the result to the user, check it against this
  exact list and fix anything you find. Do **not** flag unrelated `{{...}}` syntax that
  belongs to the target project's own domain (e.g. a project that itself uses
  double-curly-brace templating, like a `{{minutes}}` label placeholder in its own docs or
  code) — only this template's own tokens above need to be gone. The same applies to every
  `<!-- ... -->` guidance comment embedded in the template (the per-section "what to fill in
  here" notes, and the template's own leading meta-comment block) — strip all of them; the
  one exception is the Run Ledger's "living log" comment, which the template explicitly
  says to keep.
- Be specific to *this* project, not generic boilerplate. Reference actual languages,
  frameworks, file names, and constraints the user gave you.
- In the "Agent Operating Loop" section, define a generator role, an evaluator role, and a
  concrete loop description appropriate to the chosen tier.
- In "Heartbeat Rules", set a concrete max-iteration cap and human-review gate appropriate
  to the tier (smaller tiers get tighter caps; never leave this unbounded).
- In "Run Ledger", include the empty table with header row only (Session | Date | Built |
  Tested | Status) — this is a living log the *target* project's build sessions will fill
  in, not something you pre-fill.

If the target repo path doesn't exist yet and the user said "new repo", create the
directory first. Then, before writing, check whether a `CLAUDE.md` already exists at that
path in the target repo. If it does, do not overwrite it silently — tell the user one
already exists there and ask whether to overwrite it, save the generated one alongside it
(e.g. `CLAUDE.md.generated`) for them to merge by hand, or abort. Only write once they've
chosen.

Write the result to the target repo (per the user's Step 1 answer) as `CLAUDE.md`. Discard
`templates/CLAUDE.md.template`'s own leading HTML comment block (the meta-instructions
about `{{placeholder}}` rules at the very top of the template file) before writing — it
documents the template for l00prite's own maintainers and must never appear in the
generated target `CLAUDE.md`.

## Step 4 — Generate the .l00prite memory folder and Codex/Claude prompts

Create a `.l00prite/` folder in the target repo from `templates/l00prite/`. Fill obvious project-specific values in `blueprint.md`, `state.json`, `constraints.md`, and `todos.md`. Keep the files human-readable and vendor-neutral. Leave `lock.json` in its shipped `"unlocked"` state — it is not project-specific and must not be pre-filled or set to `"active"`. Do not silently overwrite existing `.l00prite/` files; ask whether to overwrite, write `.generated` copies, or abort.

Also create `.codex/prompts/` in the target repo from `templates/codex/prompts/`, including `resume-loop.md`, `heartbeat.md`, `event-loop.md`, `respond-to-review.md`, and `handoff-summary.md`. These target-project prompts must be copy/paste-friendly, must tell Codex and other CLI agents to treat `.l00prite/` as the shared source of truth, and must not assume Claude slash-command behavior. Do not silently overwrite existing `.codex/` prompt files; ask whether to overwrite, write `.generated` copies, or abort.

Also create `.claude/prompts/` in the target repo from `templates/claude/prompts/`, including the same five prompts (`resume-loop.md`, `heartbeat.md`, `event-loop.md`, `respond-to-review.md`, `handoff-summary.md`). `CLAUDE.md` is the project blueprint and entry point, but does not itself encode the lock/lease or event-lifecycle rules — these prompts are how a Claude session gets the same lock-aware, event-aware loop behavior Codex gets from `.codex/prompts/`. Do not silently overwrite existing `.claude/prompts/` files; ask whether to overwrite, write `.generated` copies, or abort.

## Step 5 — Generate the skeleton folder structure

Copy the folder structure from `templates/skeleton/<tier>/` (where `<tier>` is whatever you
picked in Step 2) into the target repo, with these rules:

- **Skip `TIER.md`.** Every tier folder ships a `TIER.md` that documents, for l00prite's own
  maintainers, when `/build-loop` should pick that tier. It is internal authoring
  documentation, not part of the scaffold — never copy it into the target repo.
- **Adapt file names and extensions to the user's actual language/stack.** Replace the
  `.stub` extension with the appropriate language extension (`.js`, `.py`, `.go`, `.md` for
  docs, etc.). For test files, don't just swap the extension — match the target language's
  own test-naming convention: `*.test.ts`/`*.test.js` for JS/TS, `test_*.py` for Python
  (never `*.test.py` — pytest's default discovery won't collect it), `*_test.go` for Go,
  `*_spec.rb` for Ruby, and so on. Pick one convention per ecosystem and apply it
  consistently across every test file in the generated skeleton — don't mix patterns. If
  you're unsure of the convention for the chosen stack, use whatever that ecosystem's
  standard test runner discovers by default.
- **Keep every copied file as a minimal stub, with no exceptions for docs or config.**
  Replace each `.stub` file's content with an equally minimal placeholder appropriate to its
  new extension (e.g. a single comment naming what belongs there) — do not write real
  implementation code, real configuration values, or fleshed-out narrative documentation
  into `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, or `config/` files. Documentation and config stubs are easy
  to over-fill because they read like prose — treat them exactly like the code stubs. For
  formats that don't support comments (JSON files like `package.json` or `tsconfig.json`,
  for example), a comment placeholder would produce invalid syntax — use a minimal valid
  empty structure instead (e.g. `{}`), not a comment. Do not invent extra structure beyond
  what the tier skeleton provides — the point is a minimal starting scaffold, not a fully
  fleshed-out app.
- **If the target is an existing repo** (not a fresh "new repo"), check each skeleton file
  against the target path first — skip any file that already exists there instead of
  overwriting it (this matters most for common filenames the skeleton ships, like
  `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), and report which paths were
  skipped so the user can merge them by hand.

## Step 6 — Give a rough, qualitative cost estimate

Tell the user the rough shape of what to expect for the tier you picked, in **qualitative**
terms only. Use language like:

- "**Small tier** projects like this typically run a modest number of agentic loop
  iterations to reach Definition of Done — think single-session, low double-digit tool
  calls."
- "**Medium tier** projects usually take more iterations across multiple review gates,
  since there's more surface area to build and test."
- "**Large tier** projects can run substantially more iterations across multiple sessions,
  especially with integration tests and multiple modules in play."

Explicitly state: **this is not a precise token or dollar estimate.** Predicting exact
agentic loop cost ahead of execution is not reliable — actual cost depends on how the
generator and evaluator roles behave, how many review cycles are needed, how much the
codebase grows, and how the user steers it. Do not give a specific token count or dollar
figure. If the user pushes for a number, repeat that it can't be reliably predicted and
point them at the qualitative tiers instead.

## Step 7 — Stop. Do not execute anything.

End the command here. Tell the user, explicitly and in plain language:

- This command does **not** execute the generated `CLAUDE.md` and does **not** run any
  build loop. It only scaffolded files: `CLAUDE.md`, `.l00prite/`, `.codex/prompts/`, and the selected skeleton.
- **Review the generated `CLAUDE.md` yourself** before running it — read it the way you'd
  read a PR, not the way you'd skim a changelog.
- If you haven't already, **set a spend limit in the Anthropic Console** before pointing an
  agentic session at this blueprint. Unsupervised agentic loops can burn real API spend if
  left unattended.
- To actually build this project with Claude, **open a fresh, separate Claude Code session** in the
  target repo and let it pick up the new `CLAUDE.md` from there.
- To resume with Codex or another CLI agent, open the target repo and use `.codex/prompts/resume-loop.md`; to process an event or review, use `.codex/prompts/event-loop.md` or `.codex/prompts/respond-to-review.md`.
- All agents should treat `.l00prite/` as the shared source of truth and update it before stopping.
  Do not continue building inside this l00prite session — l00prite's job ends at scaffolding.

Do not, under any circumstances in this command, make further tool calls against the
target repo beyond writing the `CLAUDE.md`, `.l00prite/`, `.codex/prompts/`, `.claude/prompts/`, and skeleton files described above. Do not start
implementing requirements, do not run build/test commands in the target repo, and do not
open a build loop yourself.
